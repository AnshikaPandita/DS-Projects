Project Name: CaféOrderPro

Description:
CaféOrderPro is a Java-based online ordering system that enhances café interactions and ordering procedures. It offers a user-friendly platform for café visitors to explore a diverse range of beverages, place orders, and review their order history. The project harnesses the efficiency of Java's HashMap data structure to ensure smooth operations and effective data management.

Key Data Structure: HashMap

CaféOrderPro optimizes its functionality by employing Java's HashMap. This data structure facilitates the organization and retrieval of menu categories, menu items, and user information. HashMaps play a pivotal role in swiftly presenting menu choices and ensuring secure user authentication.

How HashMap is Used:

Menu Organization: CaféOrderPro relies on HashMap<String, List<MenuItem>> to categorize menu items under Tea, Shakes, and Coffee. This ensures quick access to specific items, streamlining user choices.

User Authentication: The project employs a HashMap<String, User> to manage user data, enhancing the security of user accounts and order history access.

Features:

User Accounts: CaféOrderPro facilitates user registration and secure logins, offering personalized experiences and easy order tracking.

Menu Variety: Users can effortlessly browse through an array of beverages, conveniently categorized into Tea, Shakes, and Coffee, each accompanied by details and prices.

Seamless Ordering: Users can efficiently select beverages within categories, simplifying the ordering process.

Order Transparency: CaféOrderPro generates clear order summaries and bills, ensuring users have a precise overview of their selections.

Order History: Registered users can access their order history, enabling them to revisit preferred choices.

Optimized Data Handling: By utilizing HashMaps, the project ensures efficient organization, retrieval, and updates of menu and user data.

User-Friendly Design: CaféOrderPro prioritizes a straightforward interface, enabling smooth navigation and straightforward order placement.

Learning Opportunity: The project serves as a practical example of data structure application, offering insights into real-world software development.

CaféOrderPro showcases the seamless integration of technology into daily activities, transforming the café ordering process into an engaging and enjoyable interaction. Through this project, users gain practical insights into effective data management and user-centric design principles.
